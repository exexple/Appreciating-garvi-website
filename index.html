      <h2>A Little Letter to You</h2>
      <p>Dearest garvii,</p>
      <p>Thank you for being the kind of friend who doesn’t judge, who listens, who stays even when it would’ve been easier to walk away. You’ve stood by me through everything, making even the hardest days bearable.</p>
      <p>One of my most treasured memories will always be the day you gifted me diecast cars. You didn’t even tell me beforehand—you just surprised me with a message that said <b>“wish granted.”</b> That small act spoke volumes about the kind of person you are: thoughtful, caring, and always finding ways to make me smile.</p>
      <p>Moments like those remind me how lucky I am to call you my best friend. If “home” was a person, it would be you. Thank you for being my safe place, my hype queen, my constant.</p>
      <p class="signature">— With love, always ❤️</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Reasons I’m grateful for you</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Judgment-free — you let me be myself completely.</li>
        <li>Always there — from random texts to late-night talks.</li>
        <li>Hype queen — you celebrate my smallest wins.</li>
        <li>Safe space — I can tell you anything.</li>
        <li>Surprises — like diecast cars and “wish granted.”</li>
